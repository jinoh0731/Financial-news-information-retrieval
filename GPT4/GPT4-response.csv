0,0,ENPH,Renewable Resources & Alternative Energy,Solar Technology & Project Developers,Enphase Energy Inc,"Energy Investing Forecast: Oil and Gas Keep Rallying, ETF Strategist - ‚Ä¢ Energy stocks have been the biggest winners in the stock market over the last year.
‚Ä¢ IPaul Baiocchi of SS&C ALPS says that the rally can last another year or two.
‚Ä¢ Baiocchi explains why it makes sense to be bullish on an area investors hated for a long time.

Energy stocks have been on a remarkable run in 2022 as one of the few parts of the market that are making investors money.

While nothing lasts forever, there are good reasons to think energy stocks still have plenty of bright days ahead of them, according to Paul Baiocchi. He's the chief ETF strategist at SS&C ALPS Advisors, which manages $18 billion in assets and offers a slew of actively and passively-managed ETFs.

""The near term 12 to 24 month opportunity for energy is attractive,"" Baiocchi told Insider in a recent interview. ""So much of what's happening globally, whether it's geopolitically or economically on the domestic front, is so entwined with the energy story.""

The S&P 500's energy sector is up about 60% so far this year, a remarkable result with the overall S&P 500 down nearly 20% year-to-date. That's reflected in ALPS' results as well: its actively-managed US oil fund is up almost 33% in 2022, while its passive master limited partnership ETF has gained almost 31% and its energy infrastructure ETF has climbed 19%.

With such a remarkable rally, investors have to be wondering if it's time for what's gone up to come down. But Baiocchi says that ongoing geopolitical currents and market fundamentals are still good for energy, free cash flow generation across the industry is strong, energy stocks are deleveraging, and energy companies will still profit even if inflation stays high.

""Energy is one of the only areas of the market where you see earnings revisions upward for 2023,"" he said, while other sectors are seeing cuts. ""Energy multiples or valuations are still lower than they have been historically.""

With all of that in mind, Baiocchi says there are a lot of reasons to buy into the sector, which is a small piece of most stock portfolios. But he also believes it's still a good idea to keep the history of the energy industry in mind. ""It has been the most volatile sector for the last 10 or 20 years, and was the worst performer in 2020 before being the best one in 2021-2022,"" Baiocchi said.

Along with energy companies, he says that value stocks are better positioned than growth stocks in this higher-interest rate environment. That's an increasingly popular view, and it's very different from the investing approach that worked over the last-decade plus.

And if energy can continue to outperform, it would be a dramatic change considering how bearish investors were about energy companies just a few years ago.

As for the ongoing transition away from fossil fuels in favor of alternative energy sources, Baiocchi isn't concerned. He says his firm's clean energy strategy, which has big investments in Enphase Energy (ENPH), Rivian Automotive (RIVN), and First Solar (FSLR), is designed to profit as that shift plays out, but it won't happen overnight.

""We're still in the early innings of a lot of these applications at scale,"" he said.","{'Hazardous Waste Management': 'Solar panel manufacturing may involve the use of hazardous substances that can cause adverse health and environmentalimpacts if not properly managed. Common thin-film technologies can utilise materials including cadmium, gallium arsenide, and copper indium gallium (di)selenide, which require careful handling during the manufacturing process and disposal. The handling and disposal of hazardous wastes produced during manufacturing can lead to operating costs, capital expenditures, and in some instances result in regulatory costs. As such, effective management of hazardous materials, including through reduction, reuse, recycling, and safe storage and disposal, can lower operating costs and mitigate potential regulatory penalties or reputational damage.', 'Regulations': 'Entities in the industry have faced challenges in establishing solar energy as a cost-competitive means of energy production and GHG reduction, and they have encountered difficulty in capturing a greater market share of global energygeneration. To promote greater adoption of solar, the industry may benefit by preventing systemic disruptions to the existing energy infrastructure and essential energy services. Entities are innovating to overcome the technical challenges of increasing solar integration with the grid. They also are engaging regulatory agencies and policymakers to reduce regulatory barriers to solar energy adoption, many of which are emerging because of concerns regarding increasing overall grid electricity costs and grid disruptions. Solar entities are investing in innovative technologies to reduce hardwareand installation costs, and they are pursuing business-model innovation to reduce the cost of capital and facilitate the purchase of solar energy systems. Solar technology entities may improve their competitiveness through deploying one or more of these strategies successfully to ensure their ability to scale over the long term.', 'Product End-of-life Management': 'Solar panels may contain hazardous substances as well as reusable materials of high economic value. Given the rapid expansion of solar energy globally, increasing volumes of solar panels are expected to reach the end of their useful life in the medium term. In some regions, including parts of the EU, manufacturers are required by law to take financial responsibility for their products at the end-of-life stage, including collection and recycling. Product take-back, recycling, and disposal may result in higher upfront investments or capital expenditures for operators in the industry. However, as more modules reach the end of their life and this issue likely receives more legislative attention, entities may differentiate themselves through offering product take-back and recycling services. This could increase revenues as well as result in lower long-term costs by reusing recovered materials in manufacturing processes.', 'Water Management in Manufacturing': 'Solar photovoltaic panel manufacturing can be water-intensive, and ultra-pure water is a critical input in some processes. The manufacturing process also may generate wastewater, which must be treated before disposal or reuse, and therefore may result in incremental operating costs and capital expenditures. Furthermore, depending on the location, solar equipment manufacturing facilities may face water scarcity and related cost increases or operational disruptions. Water resource use may generate tension with local water users and associated risks, potentially disrupting manufacturing operations and adversely affecting brand value. To mitigate water supply and treatment risks, entities may adopt various strategies such as recycling process water, improving production techniques to lower water intensity, and improving watertreatment systems.', 'Energy Management in Manufacturing': 'Solar panel manufacturing typically uses electrical energy purchased from the grid. Energy can account for a considerable share of the total cost of production. Considering rising energy costs and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the future offossil-based energy, entities that diversify their energy sources may manage the associated risks and maintain a reliable energy supply more effectively. Entities that minimise energy use through effective energy management may reduce costs and gain a competitive advantage through operational efficiency and competitive pricing of products. Competitively priced products are particularly important given the intense price competition within the solar technology industry.', 'Materials Sourcing': 'Solar technology entities typically source numerous materials including polysilicon, metals, glass, and electrical components. Entities additionally utilise certain materials that are critical to solar panel and module manufacturing. Limited global resources of these critical materials, as well as their concentration in countries that may have relatively limited governance and regulatory structures or are subject to geopolitical tensions, expose entities to the risk of supply-chain disruptions and input-price increases or volatility. Entities can mitigate associated risks by ensuring transparency in their supply chains, working actively to source materials from reliable suppliers or regions that have minimal environmental or social risks, and supporting research for alternative inputs.', 'Ecological Impacts of Project Development': 'Many large, publicly listed solar technology entities are involved in project development, including the evaluation and acquisition of land rights, site permitting, and engagement with stakeholders. Successful development is contingent on securing the approval of environmental permits and the permission of local governments and communities. Siting of medium or large solar installations in ecologically sensitive areas, including endangered species habitats, can render environmental permitting more difficult and costly. Project development may also be affected by local land-use laws and community opposition to projects due to their land footprint or concerns over impacts on local water resources. These factors can slow or disrupt the development process, possibly resulting in higher costs, lost revenues, or project delays. Entities with robust strategies for environmental impact assessment and mitigation can reduce the risk of project delays, increasing the likelihood of timely project completion.'}","Hazardous Waste Management, Regulations, Product End-of-life Management, Water Management in Manufacturing, Energy Management in Manufacturing, Materials Sourcing, Ecological Impacts of Project Development","['No focus', 'No focus', 'Neutral', 'None of the topics']",No focus,No focus,Neutral,None of the topics

Some of these chemicals include persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) substances and carcinogenic, mutagen, or teratogenic chemicals, all of which are under increased regulatory scrutiny. Isolating and determining causal channels for negative health and environmental impacts is difficult, which means there is often a significant lag between a product‚Äôs introduction to the market and the point at which regulation and/or public opinion causes entities in the industry to reformulate. Directives in the EU and legislation in the U.S. place restrictions on or suggest alternatives to the use of harmful chemicals within the industry. Separately, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. may secure greater regulatory power over chemicals used by the cosmetics industry, which would very likely result in higher costs for the Household & Personal Products industry. Large retailers have implemented programs to ban chemicals of concern in the products they sell, which is placing greater pressure on the industry. Entities that are able to anticipate the changing regulatory landscape and implement stricter processes and testing are more likely to gain a competitive advantage. Early adopters of innovations in green chemistry and the reduction of chemicals of concern may improve profitability by being better able to capture changing customer demand and avoiding regulatory burdens.', 'Water Management': 'Water is vital to the Household & Personal Products industry, both as a coolant in manufacturing processes and as a main input for many of the industry‚Äôs products. Water is becoming a scarce resource around the world because of population growth and increasing consumption, rapid urbanisation, and declining supplies because of subsurface aquifer depletion, drought and climate change. Many entities in this industry have operations in regions of the world facing water scarcity. Without careful planning, entities could face increased costs or lose water access in these regions, which may be a risk to production. Having rigorous checks in place to ensure a steady supply of water to all factories, as well as investing in technology to increase water use efficiency, will help entities reduce water-related risks as water scarcity becomes an increasingly global issue.', 'Packaging Lifecycle Management': 'The Household & Personal Products industry uses a large amount of materials for product packaging, which often constitutes a significant portion of entities‚Äô expenses. In addition, packaging design, particularly packaging weight, has a direct impact on transportation expenses, which can be significant. At the same time, the industry is facing pressure from both consumers and large retail outlets to address the environmental characteristics of its packaging, as material extraction and waste contribute to environmental externalities. The sustainability performance of packaging depends largely on the type, use, and ultimate disposal of materials. However, entities that effectively manage the sustainability characteristics of their product packaging‚Äîincluding light-weighting of materials, the use of recycled content and recyclable materials, and the use of sustainably sourced materials‚Äîmay be better positioned to capture shifting consumerdemand and avoid (or mitigate the impacts of) regulation related to extended producer responsibility. By managing the sustainability of product packaging, entities can also potentially reduce input and transportation costs.', 'Environmental & Social Impacts of Palm Oil Supply Chain': 'Palm oil has increased in popularity as a cheap input for a wide range of goods in the Household & Personal Products industry, including cleaning products, candles and cosmetics. Palm oil harvesting in specific regions of the world may contribute to deforestation, GHG emissions and other environmental and social problems. If not sourced responsibly, palmoil materials contribute to environmental and social externalities that can present reputational and regulatory risks for entities. Furthermore, entities in this industry are exposed to the risk of supply chain disruptions, input price increases and reputational damage associated with environmental and social externalities from palm oil sourcing. Entities face pressure to track and responsibly source palm oil and ensure minimum working condition standards in the supply chain, because palm oil production often is associated with labour issues. Implementing sourcing standards can reduce these risks, as canproduct-design phase innovations to reduce dependence on controversial materials such as palm oil.'}","Product Environmental, Health, and Safety Performance, Water Management, Packaging Lifecycle Management, Environmental & Social Impacts of Palm Oil Supply Chain","['Major focus', 'Major focus', 'Positive', ['Product Environmental, Health, and Safety Performance', 'Water Management', 'Packaging Lifecycle Management', 'Environmental & Social Impacts of Palm Oil Supply Chain']]",Major focus,Major focus,Positive,"Product Environmental, Health, and Safety Performance, Water Management, Packaging Lifecycle Management, Environmental & Social Impacts of Palm Oil Supply Chain"
